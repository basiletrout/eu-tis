| Initial Access | T0819 | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Avalanche is commonly exposed via web interfaces; unauthenticated attackers could exploit these path traversal flaws directly. |
| Persistence | T0859 | Valid Accounts | If sensitive credentials are extracted via traversal, attacker could create persistent admin sessions. |
| Defense Evasion | T0820 | Exploitation for Defense Evasion | Path traversal could bypass access controls and security mechanisms. |
